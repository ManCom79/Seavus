Homework Task 1: Write an algorithm to determine a studentâ€™s final grade and indicate whether it is passing or failing The final grade is calculated as the average of four marks (Math, Science, History, English). The grade can be a number between 1 and 5 and the student should have at least 3 as an average grade to pass.

Solution Homework Task 1:

BEGIN
NUMBER math, science, history, english, average
OUTPUT ("Inputh grade for math: ")
INPUT math
OUTPUT ("Inputh grade for science: ")
INPUT science
OUTPUT ("Inputh grade for history: ")
INPUT history
OUTPUT ("Inputh grade for english: ")
INPUT english
average = (math + science + history + english)/4
IF average < 3
	OUTPUT("Unfortunately you have not passed the grade level.")
ELSE
	OUTPUT("Congratulations, you have passed the grade level!")
END


Homework Task 2: Write an algorithm to determine the result of the multiplication of two numbers by ONLY using the + (addition) operator.  Let's say we have two numbers (7 and 5) and we want to get the result of their multiplication but we are not allowed to use * operator but only the + operator.

Solution Homework Task 2:

BEGIN
NUMBER multiplicand, multiplicator,  product
OUTPUT ("Input multiplicand: ")
INPUT multiplicand
OUTPUT ("Inputh multiplicator: ")
INPUT multiplicator
i = 0
product = multiplicand
WHILE i < multiplicator
	product = product + multiplicand
	i++
OUTPUT("The product is: ", product)
